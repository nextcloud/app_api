### Supercharge your Nextcloud with AppAPI and applications specifically designed for it.

### This project pivots on four main pillars:

1. **Enhanced stability** This ecosystem is committed to maintaining API stability over extended periods.
   This ensures a reliable and consistent user experience as developers won't need to constantly update their apps with each new release.

2. **Enhanced security** Unlike the traditional method, which allowed direct interaction with the core Nextcloud code, this approach uses controlled APIs to manage access, ensuring greater application stability and delivering a more focused user experience.

3. **Reliable computing power** The ecosystem is designed to solve resource-intensive problems.
   Developers can easily integrate complex computing functions, including advanced machine learning models, and run them on external hardware.

4. **Community friendly** The project aims to attract a diverse and broader developer community by creating applications
   in various programming languages and providing a well-documented, consistent and user-friendly API.
   Community collaboration and contributions are encouraged to drive open source innovation.
